# Minimalistic YouTube Browser Experience

Welcome!

This project provides a filter list designed to enhance your YouTube browsing by hiding distracting elements. With `YTuBlockOriginFilterList.txt`, you can suppress flashy thumbnails, YouTube channel icons and badges, tempting YouTube Shorts suggestions, live stream chat, and prevent accessing YouTube Shorts entirely. 

## Features

- **Hide Flashy Thumbnails**: Focus on content rather than eye-catching thumbnails.
- **Suppress Channel Icons and Badges**: Maintain a clean interface.
- **Remove Shorts and Suggestions**: Completely block access to YouTube Shorts.

- and many more ...
